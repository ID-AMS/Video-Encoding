1
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:06,294
和我们的星球相比
In comparison to our planet.

2
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:10,775
和我们的宇宙相比
In comparison to our universe.

3
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:16,625
作为个体，我们显得渺小而无足轻重
As individuals, we appear small and insignificant.

4
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,905
如茫茫沙漠中的一粒沙
Like a grain of sand in a vast desert.

5
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:26,300
但我们不止于此，我们有能力做出改变
But we are more, we have the power to make a difference.

6
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:30,466
团结一致，我们可以改变一切
United as one, we can change everything.

7
00:00:30,925 --> 00:00:33,293
每个人都可以有所作为
Everyone can do something. 

8
00:00:34,467 --> 00:00:38,925
如今已经不是我们只能坐等世界流逝的时代了
It's not a time when we can just sit and watch the world go by.

9
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:45,150
我们都是相连相通的，每个人都有自己的职责
We're all connected. Each of us, we have our role to play.

10
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:50,448
我们同居一个星球，正是我们的差异使我们更加强大
We are one planet, and it's our differences that make us stronger.

11
00:00:50,448 --> 00:00:54,730
当我们把各自的努力结合起来朝着同一个目标前进时，
When we combine our individual efforts towards the same goal.

12
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:58,285
其结果将会大于部分之和
The result is greater than the sum of its parts.

13
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:01,900
在没有做到之前，这些事情看起来总是不可能的
It always seems impossible until it's done.

14
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:05,625
为了成功，我们所有人都必须一起向前迈出那一步
And to do it, we all have to take that step forward together. 

15
00:01:05,625 --> 00:01:09,690
努力的人越多，我们就越接近成功
And the more of us that try, the closer we come to succeeding.

16
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:17,052
齐心协力，我们将一步一步赢下对抗气候变化这场比赛
Together, we will win the race against climate change one step at a time.

19
00:01:58,616 --> 00:02:03,540
为环球跋涉的第一站运送车辆和后勤设施
carrying the cars and event logistics for the first stop of its global Odyssey. 

20
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:07,740
离开英国的利物浦后，经过地中海

21
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:11,759
它已到达了那伟大工程苏伊士运河的脚下
It had reached the engineering feet, that is the man made Suez Canal,

22
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:13,834
其连接着欧洲和红海
connecting Europe to the Red Sea.

23
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:20,781
选择苏伊士运河的主要原因是，船只可以直达中东、远东
The key to the Suez Canal is that ships actually can access the Middle East, the Far East  

24
00:02:20,781 --> 00:02:24,910
而不用绕过非洲的底部和南非
without having to go round the bottom of Africa and around South Africa.

25
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:27,428
没有必要这样做，所以节省了大量的时间
There's no need to do that, so there's a big time saving,

26
00:02:27,428 --> 00:02:29,790
当然也节省了大量的燃料
and also, of course, a big fuel saving.

27
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:31,213
因为距离更短
Because it's a lot less miles.

28
00:02:31,213 --> 00:02:33,172
每个人都要齐心协力作为一个团队
Everyone's come together as a team, 

29
00:02:33,172 --> 00:02:35,188
这是在船员较少的情况下
and that's the only way with a smaller crew 

30
00:02:35,188 --> 00:02:39,530
而完成所有需要在运河上进行的工作的唯一方式
that you'll get all the jobs that are needed to be done on the in the canal.

31
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:42,075
对Helena号运输船来说，所有的事情都将是第一次
Everything has really been at first for St. Helena, 

32
00:02:42,075 --> 00:02:45,563
总会有压力，总会有挑战
there's always an element of pressure, there's always an element of a challenge.

33
00:02:45,563 --> 00:02:48,695
我已经在这里待了两个半月
I've been on board down for two and a half month,

34
00:02:48,695 --> 00:02:51,070
每一天都有新的挑战
I don't think there hasn't been a day where I haven't had a challenge,

35
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:53,654
但我也享受这里每一天
but there also hasn't been a day that I haven't enjoyed.

36
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:59,300
在海上航行数周后，抵达沙特阿拉伯吉达港口
On reaching the Saudi Arabian ports of Jeddah after weeks at sea,

37
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:04,595
是时候从船上卸下9辆电动赛车和50个集装箱了
it was time to unload the nine electric race cars and fifty containers from the ship.

38
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:11,570
我惊住了
I'm just absolutely shocked.

39
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:14,977
惊讶、狂喜和快乐同时涌上心头
And amazed and ecstatic and happy all at once, 

40
00:03:14,977 --> 00:03:19,448
我们将把Helena号带回英国
you know the journey that we've been going to to bring in the St. Helena back to the UK.

41
00:03:19,448 --> 00:03:21,804
改装一下，做好准备
to refitting it to getting it ready 

42
00:03:21,804 --> 00:03:27,849
现在看到我们的这些车，被完美的运送到吉达进行第一场比赛

43
00:03:27,849 --> 00:03:30,736
这是大家共同努力的结果
What an amazing achievement from everybody,

44
00:03:30,736 --> 00:03:36,060
无论是在岸上的工作人员还是在我船上的团队，看到这些漂亮的赛车
both shoreside and everybody at my team on board to see these wonderful cars,  

45
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:40,408
这是Extreme E第一季迈出的伟大一步
and a great step forward for season one with Extreme E.

46
00:03:40,408 --> 00:03:42,827
这绝对是非凡的成就
Fantastic achievement.

47
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:53,212
在欧洲、非洲和亚洲的交界处
At a junction between Europe, Africa and Asia.

48
00:03:53,212 --> 00:03:59,010
沙特阿拉伯是一个幅员辽阔的国家，占据了阿拉伯半岛的大部分地区
Saudi Arabia is a vast country occupying the majority of the Arabian Peninsula.

49
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:06,130
古老的阿卢拉城坐落在世界上第二大沙漠的西北角
The ancient city of Alula sits in the northwest corner of the second largest desert in the world.

50
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:09,900
它建立于2500多年前
First founded over two and a half thousand years ago.

51
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:12,962
是“香料之路”上的重要一站

52
00:04:12,962 --> 00:04:16,750
迎接疲惫的旅客来到它的自然绿洲
welcoming weary travellers to its natural oasis.

53
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:20,371
但是，在年年都变得越干越热的环境中
But underground water sources such as these are becoming rarer 

54
00:04:20,371 --> 00:04:24,226
这样的地下水源变得越来越稀少
in an environment that is getting hotter and dryer every year.

55
00:04:24,902 --> 00:04:26,131
沙漠是很广阔的
Deserts are enormous.

56
00:04:26,131 --> 00:04:29,834
世界上大约40%的地区是旱地
About 40% of the world is dryland region,

57
00:04:29,834 --> 00:04:34,050
而世界上大约30%左右的人口生活在这些地区
and around thirty something percent of the world's population lives in these regions.

58
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:38,857
这种生活并不容易，这是我们所面临的困难
It's not an easy life, so making that life harder is the difficulty that we face. 

59
00:04:38,857 --> 00:04:43,552
沙漠化是土地干涸后退化的过程
Desertification is the process of degrading the land as it dries out.

60
00:04:43,552 --> 00:04:46,784
未来，我们还会看到沙漠的扩张
In the future, we'll see with the desert's expanding, 

61
00:04:46,784 --> 00:04:50,139
陆地和海洋表面的温度记录显示
Observed land and sea surface temperature record shows us 

62
00:04:50,139 --> 00:04:54,080
从1860年开始，气温上升了大约1摄氏度
that warming is around a degree C over the period from 1860. 

63
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:58,816
经过证明，25年来这是由于二氧化碳量的增加
And we've proven, twenty twenty five years ago that that's due to the increase in carbon dioxide,

64
00:04:58,816 --> 00:05:01,714
但在之后，接近21世纪末
but in the future, towards the end of the 21st century, 

65
00:05:01,714 --> 00:05:05,240
我们发现亚热带地区明显变暖
we see marked warming in the subtropics of the world.

66

在阿拉伯半岛的沙漠、北非、非洲南部，有些升温高达6摄氏度
up to sixty degrees C across the deserts of the Arabian Peninsula, north Africa, and also in southern Africa. 

67
00:05:11,067 --> 00:05:14,105
这些地区比热带地区变暖情况严重得多
This region of the world warms far more than the tropics. 

68
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,797
我们的命运将与我们对气候系统的所作所为息息相关
Our fortunes are going to be bound up in what we've done to this climate system.

69
00:05:18,797 --> 00:05:21,654
这既需要缓解，也需要适应
it's both the question of mitigation and adaptation. 

70
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:22,797
我们需要减缓气候变暖的进程
We need to slow it down, 

71
00:05:22,797 --> 00:05:26,530
同时我们也要有能力承担自己所造成后果
and we need to be able to deal with what we've committed ourselves to.

72
00:05:30,045 --> 00:05:32,780
位于城外几英里处
Situated a few miles outside the city.

73
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:36,781
第一场极限电动车拉力大奖赛即将举行
The site for the first ever Extreme E X-Prix was coming together 

74
00:05:36,781 --> 00:05:41,690
同时也会小心地保护沙漠的壮丽景观
with great care taking place to respect the stunning backdrop of the desert surroundings.

75
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:47,740
对于创始人兼首席执行官Alejandro Agag来说，这一刻代表着四年计划时间的结束
For founder and CEO, Alejandro Agag, this moment represents the end of four years of planning.

76
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:51,488
他对成功举办赛事的态度很明确
And his feelings of finally being able to go racing was clear.

77
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:54,420
感觉如释重负
Feels great relief, 

78
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:56,842
我们做了很多工作，终于来到这里
I mean, we're finally here. It's been a lot of work,

79
00:05:56,842 --> 00:06:01,700
我们经历了很多波澜：新冠疫情、英国脱欧、苏伊士运河堵船，所有你能想到的这些困难
a lot of curve balls to us. COVID, Brexit, the Suez canal, you name it,

80
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:04,902
我们都克服了。我们现在来到这里，举办首场Extreme E赛事。
We made it. We're here. First Extreme E race. 

81
00:06:04,902 --> 00:06:07,466
有很多次，我都觉得这可能会半途而废
Many times, I felt that this could stop or could fail, 

82
00:06:07,466 --> 00:06:09,990
但幸运的是我们得到了许多支持，这就是我们成功的原因
but luckily, we had so much support. That's why we made it.

83
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:14,496
我们将许多赛车界名宿带到这个全新的概念中
We've been able to bring the incredible names of motorsport to a completely new concept, 

84
00:06:14,496 --> 00:06:16,250
出于一个初衷
and all with the same mission.

85
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:18,646
让它成为一个平台
Make it become a platform to, you know, 

86
00:06:18,646 --> 00:06:22,375
让尽可能多的人通过运动赛事走上环保之路
bring as many people as possible on the journey towards climate action through sport. 

87
00:06:22,375 --> 00:06:24,150
未来将会是很光明的
Then I think it will be beautiful tomorrow.

88
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:26,372
随着场地建设的顺利进行
With site built well underway, 

89
00:06:26,372 --> 00:06:29,615
下一项工作是测试赛车场
the next job was to test the course that had been designed

90
00:06:29,615 --> 00:06:35,060
其设计工作是在两届DTM冠军，拉力越野车手Timo Scheider的帮助下完成的。
with the help of two time DTM champion, and Rally Cross driver Timo Scheider.

91
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:41,323
这将是第一次纯电动的Odyssey 21赛车在一条充满挑战的赛道上进行测试
This would be the first time the all electric Odyssey 21 car would be tested on a competitive course.

92
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:45,540
我们要用这辆车摸清楚这条赛道的布局
We are trying to figure out the track layout with this real car.

93
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:48,451
另一方面对于技师们和赛车来说
And on the other side as well, for the technicians and for the car, 

94
00:06:48,451 --> 00:06:51,060
我认为还需要进行一些微调
I think there are some fine tuning things We need to look at.

95
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:56,130
这感觉有点像首秀，作为第一个真正上手开Odyssey 21的人
It feels a bit like a world premier somehow, being the first guy hitting out with the Odyssey 21.

96
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:58,676
现在这些要踏上它们的第一条赛道
Now they are on the first track ever. 

97
00:06:58,676 --> 00:07:02,526
这种感觉很棒，所以我现在很期待上车一试
It's a very nice feeling, so I'm really looking forward now to jump into.

98
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:08,902
这条长达8 8公里的线路在这些砂岩之间蜿蜒而行
The 8.8 kilometer circuit winds its way between these huge piles of sandstone.

99
00:07:08,902 --> 00:07:13,804
不断上下起伏
Constantly undulating up and then down some seriously steep sections.

100
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:20,451
轮胎要应对碎石、泥土、散沙这些不同路面
With the mix of gravel, dirt and soft sand for its tires to deal with,

101
00:07:20,451 --> 00:07:25,744
这对于车辆和车手都将是巨大的挑战
the first ever Desert X-Prix will provide a huge challenge for the cars and their drivers

102
00:07:27,338 --> 00:07:32,992
几圈后，测试车手Timo与副车手Jutta Kleinschmidt
After a few laps, the test and reserved drivers, Timo alongside compatriot Jutta Kleinschmidt, 

103
00:07:32,992 --> 00:07:36,030
对于这条赛道的挑战性，他们感到很高兴
were happy with how much of a challenge the course would be.

104
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:41,065
说实话，你必须认清自己的路
To be honest, it's very tricky, and you have to find your way, 

105
00:07:41,065 --> 00:07:43,010
尤其是当你不完全了解赛道的时候，这是很难做到的
especially when you don't know the track well, this can be a huge challenge, 

106
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:46,800
你将面临各种机会，你将面临-
and you have chance and you have um-

107
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,699
-各种各样的选择，对吧
-Many options, right? 

108
00:07:47,721 --> 00:07:50,616
检查点的门很宽，你可以选择向左或者向右
So the gates are quite wide, so you can go right and left, 

109
00:07:50,616 --> 00:07:53,420
选择很多，我觉得这样很好
you have many options, so that's super nice, I guess.

110
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:55,368
这会给车手更多的选择
So this gives a lot of option for the drivers. 

111
00:07:55,368 --> 00:07:58,165
赛道现在处于一个完美的状态
The track is set up in a perfect condition right now. 

112

从车辆的动态来看，我认为这条赛道会特别特别的棒
From the pure feeling in the motions, I have to say this will be super super nice.

113
00:08:06,947 --> 00:08:11,030
Extreme E对每一位参与者来说都是未知的冒险
Extreme E is a venture into the unknown for everyone involved.

114
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:15,919
对于七届F1世界冠军Lewis Hamilton更是如此
But none more so than seven times Formula One world champion Lewis Hamilton, 

115
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:18,766
这是他第一次组建自己的车队
who has set up his own team for the first time.

116
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:23,729
有些事情如果眼不见就很难相信
It's very hard sometimes to believe in something, if you can't see it. 

117
00:08:23,729 --> 00:08:27,729
参与到这样一项有意义有影响力的事情中不是很好吗？
Wouldn't it be great to be a part of something that really does make a difference?

118
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:35,248
在我现在的生活阶段，我想努力对这个星球产生一些积极的影响
Where I am in my life, I'm looking to see how I can have a positive impact on the planet.

119
00:08:35,248 --> 00:08:38,685
在过去的十年里，人们对教育越来越重视
Over the last ten years, there's been a huge focus on education, 

120
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:43,308
人们对世界的认知越来越重要
people understanding what is happening in the world is becoming more and more of an issue.

121
00:08:43,308 --> 00:08:46,947
我是在自然吸气发动机的世界中长大的
I've grown up in normally aspirated engine world, 

122
00:08:46,947 --> 00:08:51,097
我爱V12，我爱V10，我永远不会喜欢电动汽车
like, I love V12s, I love V10s, I'm never going to love an electric car.

123
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:55,127
然后我就有了这么一辆电动汽车，这些车开起来一点也不枯燥
Then I got an electric car, and they are so much fun, 

124
00:08:55,127 --> 00:08:58,135
马力的输出没有任何滞后
it's so impressive, the power delivery is no delay.

125
00:08:58,135 --> 00:09:01,378
最令你吃惊的可能是那巨大的扭矩
That's probably the biggest shock is just how much torque you're able to get. 

126
00:09:01,378 --> 00:09:06,406
现在我正把所有的车，比如梅奔赞助的一些，转向电动化
Now I'm converting all the cars that like Mercedes, providing, I want it to be fully electric.

127
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:11,234
体育可以帮助提高社会认知，这是一个很好平台
Sport has an opportunity to help raise awareness. There is a platform. 

128
00:09:11,234 --> 00:09:14,219
我喜欢流媒体的原因是
And the reason I really love streaming,  we're taking off two boxes.  

129
00:09:14,219 --> 00:09:17,353
我们一方面可以去赛车，做这些娱乐性的事
You get to do the racing, the entertainment and fun stuff.

130
00:09:17,353 --> 00:09:20,330
但当中的本质，同时也是我们能这样做的真正原因
But actually at the core of it, the real reason that we're there 

131
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:23,810
是为了提高人们对这些地区中问题的认识
is to raise awareness for the issues that are in those places.

132
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:26,436
从8岁起我就是在赛车中长大的
I've grown up in motor racing my whole life since I was eight. 

133
00:09:26,436 --> 00:09:28,996
赛车就一直是一项男性主导的运动
It has been a male dominated sport. 

134
00:09:28,996 --> 00:09:32,360
它现在仍然是一项明显男性主导的运动
It still is a strongly male dominated sport,

135
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,977
我真的认为这一点需要改变
and I really think that that needs to change.

136
00:09:34,977 --> 00:09:38,155
要让更多的年轻女性知道
There are a lot of young girls out there 

137
00:09:38,155 --> 00:09:41,470
她们在赛车运动中是有机会的
that need to know that there is opportunity for them in motor sport.

138
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:46,345
我很乐于看到她们所传递出的不同的信息
I'm really excited to see a difference that they bring and the message that we're able to project.

139
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:49,293
我的角色更像是一个梦想家
My role is more like the, I would say the visionary, 

140
00:09:49,293 --> 00:09:52,240
我知道我想要什么，我知道我所希望的团队是什么样子
I know what I want, I know how I want my team to look. 

141
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,977
我在努力组建一支最优秀的团队
I'm trying to put together the best team.

142
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,451
这是我第一次需要去选择车手
The first time I've ever had to choose drivers. 

143
00:09:58,451 --> 00:10:01,880
作为车手，我一直在寻找那些敢于推向极限的人
From a drivers perspective, I'm always looking for someone that's pushing the limit.

144
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:04,696
我们有Cristina Gutiérrez，她已经获得多个冠军
We got Cristina Gutiérrez, having won multiple championships,

145
00:10:04,696 --> 00:10:07,034
在达卡拉力赛的第一阶段处于领先位置
and leading the first state of the Dakar rally. 

146
00:10:07,034 --> 00:10:09,840
可靠性和稳定性将是非常非常关键的
Reliability and consistency is very, very key.

147
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:14,586
在这些地方攀爬要求要懂得保护车辆
Going to these places where understanding how to look after the car in those climb is going to be key. 

148
00:10:14,586 --> 00:10:17,383
所以我认为她会是团队合适的人选
So I think that she's going to be a great asset for the team 

149
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:23,067
Sébastien Loeb是九届世界冠军，他几乎统治着拉力界
Sébastien Loeb, nine time world champion. He dominated the rally world.

150
00:10:23,879 --> 00:10:26,736
他们知道在车里该做什么，我不可能指导他们
They know what to do in the car, I can't tell them what to do in the car, 

151
00:10:26,736 --> 00:10:30,496
但在幕后，我要带领团队，确保我们有正确的人手
but in the back, setting off the team, making sure that we've got the right people 

152
00:10:30,496 --> 00:10:32,842
这样我们才能有正常甚至超常的发挥
so that we deliver over and above.

153
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:37,024
如果没有这次机会，我可能只能梦想拥有一支车队
I could have only ever dreamed of owning a team. 

154
00:10:37,024 --> 00:10:41,594
我认为前景可期
It's quite an exciting new prospect that that I think is, 

155
00:10:41,594 --> 00:10:43,639
从不同角度看事物总会是令人兴奋的
you know, it can be exciting for people to see something different.

156
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:49,310
赛道已经设置好
The track was set.

157
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:52,330
车手们和他们的Odyssey21赛车准备好了
The drivers and their Odyssey 21 cars were ready. 

158
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:56,490
随着各团队开始进行试跑
It was finally time to see what this unforgiving track was made of 

159
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:58,736
终于是时候看看这是一条怎样残酷的赛道了
as the teams headed out for shakedown.

160
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:00,456
我很期待这条赛道
I'm super excited for this track. 

161
00:11:00,456 --> 00:11:03,428
毕竟第一次跑，你可能会看到很多车手停在
I mean, the first drive, you've probably seen a lot of the drivers stopping on this big, 

162
00:11:03,428 --> 00:11:07,510
这个巨大的下坡前，几乎是悬崖一样的地方，简直像过山车
almost cliff, really, just down, like a huge, big side, almost a roller coaster.

163
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:09,460
这也让赛道看起来非常壮观
Made it, you know, pretty spectacular to look at, 

164
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,729
这条赛道跑起来一定会特别刺激
and it's going to be super exciting to drive, I think.

165
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:16,412
这条赛道很疯狂
The course is absolutely insane. 

166
00:11:16,412 --> 00:11:18,526
我惊讶于赛道中容纳的元素
I was actually quite shocked with what they put in, you know.

167
00:11:18,526 --> 00:11:21,203
我知道有时候赛车运动如同走在安全的边界上
Sometimes motorsport can go on the edge of safety, 

168
00:11:21,203 --> 00:11:24,190
但那个下坡实在是够陡峭的
but that drop is definitely pretty steep.

169
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:28,060
最大的挑战将是要能够自如地驾驶而且适应不断变化的环境
The biggest challenge will be being able to be spontaneous and adapting to the changing environments. 

170
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:30,436
这绝对是对我们技能和赛车感觉的考验
That's really going to test our skills and that sense.

171
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:33,804
赛道真的很极端
The track is really extreme. 

172
00:11:33,804 --> 00:11:37,644
赛道表面时刻都在变化，所以赛道上处处都是挑战
The surface is really changing, so there are challenges all over the track, 

173
00:11:37,644 --> 00:11:39,278
但这就是Extreme E的精髓
but that's what Extreme E is all about.

174
00:11:39,278 --> 00:11:42,586
我们要把车手、赛车和轮胎推到极限。
We need to put the drivers, the car and the tires to the limits.

175
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:48,210
这地方的风景很棒，我跑达卡的时候就有所了解
The landscape is amazing, I already knew from Dakar. 

176
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:51,730
在自己熟悉的地形比赛上感觉不错
It feels good to be in a terrain more familiar to me.

177
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:54,680
如果你之前从来没有来过沙漠，你可能会觉得有点害怕
If you never been in the in the sand before, it's a bit scary.

178
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:57,234
对我来说这是家常便饭，我已经习惯了
For me it's normal. I-I think this is not a problem, 

179
00:11:57,234 --> 00:12:01,850
我很期待比赛开始，但同时也很紧张，因为一切都是全新的
I'm excited to start, but also be, you know, nervous, because here it's everything new.

180
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:03,578
有很多事情需要考虑
Many things to to think about. 

181
00:12:03,578 --> 00:12:05,323
我有很多东西要学
I have everything to learn.

182
00:12:08,721 --> 00:12:13,286
试车日是车队唯一的机会摸清楚车的抓地力，并做好调整
Shakedown is the only chance of the teams to try and get to grips with the car and set up 

183
00:12:13,286 --> 00:12:17,172
以便在排位赛中把车发挥到极限
before they would push it to its limits a day later in qualifying.

184
00:12:18,706 --> 00:12:25,594
但不幸的是，对于Ganassi Chip Racing车队的车手Kyle LeDuc，他推的有点过于激进了
Unfortunately for Segi TV Ganassi Chip racing driver, Kyle LeDuc, he pushed a little too hard,

185
00:12:25,594 --> 00:12:28,992
并很快意识到这条沙漠赛道容错率很低。
And quickly learned that this desert track takes no prisoners.

186
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,969
兄弟们，有事故，有事故
Guys, big crash, big crash, 

187
00:12:35,969 --> 00:12:38,586
我撞到分割线上的石头了
I hit the big rock on the split line guys.

188
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:43,939
这是我自己的一个重大失误。我本来不需要在这一节推的这么狠
It was a big mistake on my behalf, pushing too hard on a session that I didn't have to. 

189
00:12:43,939 --> 00:12:47,680
这对我们来说是非常糟糕的第一天，绝对不是什么值得骄傲的事情
It was a very bad first day for us, something we're definitely not proud of.

190
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,408
但是现在没有退路，只能继续向前，所以我们仍然保持兴奋
There is no way but up right now, so we're excited, 

191
00:12:50,408 --> 00:12:53,293
保持清醒，油门到底
eyes up wide awake, throttle to the floor.

192
00:12:56,330 --> 00:13:01,209
我们来到沙特阿拉伯第一次进行Extreme E的比赛
We're in Saudi Arabia for the first ever Extreme E Desert X-Prix. 

193
00:13:01,209 --> 00:13:04,400
在我们进入第一场比赛之前
Before we get into the first competitive action,

194
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:07,270
车手们被欢迎到Helena号上
the drivers were welcomed on board the St. Helena,

195
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:10,827
在这里，来自阿卜杜拉国王科技大学的Extreme E科学委员会成员Carlos Duarte
where Extreme E scientific committee member Carlos Duarte 

196
00:13:10,827 --> 00:13:14,210
在这里，来自阿卜杜拉国王科技大学的Extreme E科学委员会成员Carlos Duarte
from the King Abdullah University of science and Technology, 

197
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:17,263
组织了一场关于美妙但脆弱的红海生态的教育项目
had put together a program of environmental education 

198
00:13:17,263 --> 00:13:20,992
组织了一场关于美妙但脆弱的红海生态的教育项目
about the incredible yet threatened Red Sea ecosystems.

199
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:26,415
我受到了Extreme E初衷的鼓舞
I'm really motivated by the mission of Extreme E. 

200
00:13:26,415 --> 00:13:31,065
Extreme E采纳的主要项目
The main project that Extreme E has adopted in the Red Sea 

201
00:13:31,065 --> 00:13:38,420
是观察气候变暖对海龟数量的影响
is a project aiming at observe globally relevant population of sea turtles from climate change.

202
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:42,797
红海中主要有两种海龟
So there's two main species of turtles in the Red Sea, 

203
00:13:42,797 --> 00:13:46,701
一种是以海草为食的绿甲海龟
one is the green turtle that feeds on sea grass 

204
00:13:46,701 --> 00:13:49,645
它们是红海中数量最多的海龟
and is the most abundant of the sea turtles in the Red Sea. 

205
00:13:49,645 --> 00:13:53,700
第二种是濒危的玳瑁龟
And the second is critically endangered hawksbill turtle 

206
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:57,005
这是海洋中最濒危的物种之一
that is one of the most endangered animals in the ocean. 

207
00:13:57,005 --> 00:13:59,849
海龟从水里出来产卵
So the turtles come out from the water to lay their eggs, 

208
00:13:59,849 --> 00:14:03,250
这是它们出生三十年来第一次的产卵行为
and they do that for the first time thirty years after they're born.

209
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:06,225
但它们对同一片海滩有很强的归属感
But they have high fidelity to the same beach, 

210
00:14:06,225 --> 00:14:10,040
所以在海洋中漫游了三十年后，它们还会回到
so after thirty years of roaming the ocean, they will come back.

211
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:12,990
离他们出生地不到150米的地方
within 150 meters from the place they were born.

212
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:15,428
它们将第一次在那里产卵
And they will lay eggs there for the first time, 

213
00:14:15,428 --> 00:14:20,430
此后每三五年它们都会在这里产一次卵，直到生命结束
and they will continue to do that every three, five years through the extended life span.

214
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:24,000
所以当卵孵化时，它们会进行一场极限的比赛
So when the eggs hatch, then they do an extreme race. 

215
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,520
这是它们必经的历程，可能只是一场大概20秒的比赛
They have to do it, that's maybe a twenty second race.

216
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,824
但这是它们有能力赢下的比赛
But it's a race that they are able to win it. 

217
00:14:29,824 --> 00:14:35,127
奖励是60到90年的快乐海洋生活
The reward is a sixty to ninety year of happy life in the ocean.

218
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:40,520
我们发现在连续两年里，海龟幼崽死亡率超过90%
We found in two consecutive years, there was more than 90% mortality.

219
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:44,490
因为随着气候变化，海平面会迅速上升，
Because very rapid sea level rise with climate change.

220
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:50,706
导致那些曾经对它们来说很安全的产卵地变得容易被海水淹没。
Then the areas that used to be safe for them to lay their eggs are becoming prone to be flooded.

221
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:53,383
在每一个比赛地点
At every race location, 

222
00:14:53,383 --> 00:14:59,470
Extreme E将与当地组织合作，留下积极的影响
Extreme E will be working together with local organizations to leave behind a positive legacy.

223
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:03,609
在沙特阿拉伯，它将与Bar Foundation合作
And in Saudi Arabia, it is collaborated with the Bar Foundation 

224
00:15:03,609 --> 00:15:06,553
帮助保护受到海平面上升和塑料污染威胁的重要海龟产卵地
to help preserve an important turtle nesting site 

225
00:15:06,553 --> 00:15:10,285
重要海龟产卵地
that is threatened by sea level rises and plastic pollution.

226
00:15:10,285 --> 00:15:13,353
有些车手亲自去查看
And some of the drivers were taken to have a look for themselves.

227
00:15:13,624 --> 00:15:15,819
我们去拯救海龟！
Let's go save the turtles!

228
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:22,570
我们科学家的声音很小
We scientists have a very small voice.

229
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:25,172
我们不接触观众，我们的影响力很小
We don't reach audiences, we have very little influence, 

230
00:15:25,172 --> 00:15:29,050
所以Extreme E把科学转化成了行动
so Extreme E is translating that science into action.

231
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:33,624
Extreme E作为一种大家喜闻乐见的赛车形式，十分适合与我们合作
And it's only fitting that Extreme E main form operation is racing, 

232
00:15:33,624 --> 00:15:39,699
因为解决问题的窗口很狭窄而且窗口在迅速关闭
because the window to solve the problem is narrow is rapidly closing.

233
00:15:39,699 --> 00:15:41,293
现在我们有一个与气候变暖之间的比赛
So now we have a race, 

234
00:15:41,293 --> 00:15:46,440
一项为了世界未来，为了我们子孙的比赛
a race for a future for the world, a future for our children and grandchildren.

235
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,558
我们需要小心地计划这场比赛
And we need to plan that race carefully, 

236
00:15:48,558 --> 00:15:51,819
因为我们没机会输，我们必须赢得这场比赛
because we have not one second to lose, and we must win it.

237
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:57,590
从一个在地球上游荡了数亿年的古老物种
From an ancient species that had been roaming the earth for hundreds of millions of years.

238
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:59,669
到这台顶级的赛车终于准备好首次在沙漠中驰骋
To a cutting edge racing machine 

239
00:15:59,669 --> 00:16:04,630
到这台顶级的赛车终于准备好首次在沙漠中驰骋
that  was finally ready to take on the desert for the first time in competitive action. 

240
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:08,565
在此之前 让我们具体了解一下它背后的一些技术
Before it does, let's take a closer look at some of the technology behind it.

241
00:16:10,736 --> 00:16:15,849
Extreme E的革命性SUV——Odyssey 21
Extreme E's revolutionary electric SUV, the Odyssey 21 

242
00:16:15,849 --> 00:16:20,170
被设计用来接受赛车运动中最艰难的挑战
is designed to take on perhaps the toughest challenge in motorsport.

243
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:27,860
这辆纯电动的机器将驰骋泥地、沙地、石地、水洼和雪地
The all-electric machine will race across and through mud, sand, rock, water and snow.

244
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:31,428
从炎热的沙漠和潮湿的热带雨林
From the heat and humidity of the desert and tropical rainforest 

245
00:16:31,428 --> 00:16:34,590
到北极苔原和冰川地带
to Arctic tundra and glacial base.

246
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:39,300
Odyssey 21是当今科技的杰作
The Odyssey 21 is an outstanding feat of racing technology.

247
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:43,043
车的电池来自于威廉姆斯
The car's battery, produced by Williams® Advanced Engineering, 

248
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:46,120
可储存40千瓦时的可用能量
stores 40 kilowatt hours of usable energy.

249
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,578
换言之
To put that into perspective, 

250
00:16:47,578 --> 00:16:53,960
这台设备所储存的能量可以让2600部手机充电一周
the stored energy of this device could keep 2600 phones charged for a week.

251
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:57,464
配备的电机相当于一台550匹马力的内燃机
The equivalent of a five hundred and fifty horse power combustion engine. 

252
00:16:57,464 --> 00:17:01,700
它能产生1000 N·m的扭矩
It's capable of creating 1000 N·m of torque.

253
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:07,398
这是一台非常强劲，非常灵活的车，在沙丘上跑起来感觉飞快
It's very powerful, quite reactive car, so you feel so fast about the dunes on the gravel. 

254
00:17:07,398 --> 00:17:08,571
很震撼
It's impressive.

255
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:15,458
Odyssey 21配备有双电机，独立向前后传动轴输出动力
The Odyssey 21 is equipped with duel motors feeding the front and rear axles independently.

279
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:44,786
但在车手排行榜中
But in the driver's championship, 

280
00:18:44,786 --> 00:18:51,548
参赛者可以将本赛季最差的结果赌在可能的冠军车队上
competitors can drop their worst result of the season in their bid to be crowned the first Extreme E champion.

281
00:18:53,323 --> 00:18:56,380

之后就全是靠着轮毂撑回来的

月亮或太阳的位置

383
00:24:12,255 --> 00:24:16,735
对于我们了解阳历或阴历是很重要的

通过这样的方式，我们可以区分不同的季节

对于这些人，利用星星是很重要的技能

386
00:24:21,612 --> 00:24:24,990

也有极高温的酷暑
and then extreme heat in the in the summer.

390
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:38,118
当然，他们更多是借助星星在夜晚出行而不是白天
Of course, they relied on the stars to travel at night more than the daytime, 

391
00:24:38,118 --> 00:24:40,188
为了避开日光的炎热
to escape the heat of the sun.

392
00:24:40,188 --> 00:24:44,604
因为他们要长途跋涉
And also because of the long distances that they had cross for them. 

393
00:24:44,604 --> 00:24:48,123
所以了解水源的位置，
That was very important to know where the water sources are 

394
00:24:48,123 --> 00:24:49,964
了解村庄的位置，
where the next villages are,

395
00:24:49,964 --> 00:24:51,939
下一个绿洲可能的位置，是很重要的
the next oasis might be

396
00:24:51,939 --> 00:24:56,390
对于他们来说基本就是为了生存
For them to just keep alive basically. 

397
00:24:56,390 --> 00:24:58,780
观星定位对于他们
For them to know the stars,

398
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:02,760
是很基本的尝试，甚至孩子们都知道如何观星
know their location was so common sense that even kids know the stars.

399
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,860
如果你问一位阿拉伯人
If you were to ask an Arab person, 

400
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:06,076
你了解这片天空吗
do you know about the sky , 

401
00:25:06,076 --> 00:25:07,164
他会为你感到丢脸
he would be shame on you, 

402
00:25:07,164 --> 00:25:10,426
我怎么能不了解我自家的屋顶？
how can I not know the ceiling of my own house?

403
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:16,691
有些人在仰望沙漠上的星空
While some gazed up at the starry skies above the Saudi deserts, 

404
00:25:16,691 --> 00:25:20,716
但是Extreme E的队员们仍然在努力工作
many of the Extreme E teams were still hard at work.

405
00:25:20,716 --> 00:25:24,428
为X-Prix的第二天做好准备
Preparing for what day two of the Desert X-Prix would bring.

406
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,639
下期Electric Odyssey中
Next time on Electric Odyssey, 

407
00:25:27,639 --> 00:25:29,614
我们终于能看到
we finally get to see what happened 

408
00:25:29,614 --> 00:25:32,661
各车队轮对轮比赛
when the teams lined up to go wheel to wheel racing.

409
00:25:33,594 --> 00:25:35,650
三车并排前进
Side by side now, 

410
00:25:36,721 --> 00:25:38,676
Carlos Sainz抽头
Carlos Sainz is in the lead here. 

411
