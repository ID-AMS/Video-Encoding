1
00:00:01,425 --> 00:00:05,600
McLaren's entering Extreme E because first we think it's a fascinating championship.

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:08,800
We have a long history in pioneering and innovation,

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,675
which is clearly what the Extreme E championship has been founded on

4
00:00:12,675 --> 00:00:17,550
and sustainability and diversity, two very important issues in the world today

5
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:21,475
and we feel we can use the racing platform to put on a great show,

6
00:00:21,475 --> 00:00:24,775
but also to accelerate our learning in sustainability

7
00:00:24,775 --> 00:00:27,300
and being able to contribute to making the world a better place.

8
00:00:27,975 --> 00:00:31,350
McLaren is basically motorsport.

9
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:33,375
McLaren is the history of motorsport.

10
00:00:33,375 --> 00:00:34,575
McLaren is the glory.

11
00:00:34,575 --> 00:00:37,250
McLaren is the titles in many different championships.

12
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:40,325
And then also McLaren is the view of the future.

13
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:45,250
And McLaren represents really what we want to have in Extreme E:

14
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:47,850
a great competitor, a team that is a winner

15
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:54,375
but also a team that shares our values for the preservation of our planet, of the environment.

16
00:00:54,375 --> 00:00:56,300
I think it's a great addition to Extreme E.
